Online references used
  1. Starscream (https://github.com/daltoniam/Starscream)
  2. PopupDialog (https://github.com/Orderella/PopupDialog)

Enhancement: 
  I've added some popup dialogs to notify users whether 
the connection to the server is successful or not.

Note: 
  Since I used Cocoapod as my package manager, 
in order to open the project properly, you should open the 
Xcode workspace file (with file extension .xcworkspace), 
in stead of opening the Xcode project file (with file extension .xcproject)
